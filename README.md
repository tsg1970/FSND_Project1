# Project Overview

To create a website that shows the trailers of my 6 favorite movies. It also shows the movie poster and name of the movie.

To view the trailers the user will run the entertainment_center.py file. The entertainment_center.py file will call the Movie Class in the media.py file and open the fresh_tomatoes webpage. The webpage will show the posters of my 6 favorite movies. The trailer will open in another window when the user clicks on the movie poster.
